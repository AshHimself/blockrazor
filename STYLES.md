# Blockrazor Coding Style Guidelines

The intention of this coding style guide is to provide a **minimum** number of rules to make code more readable, and also to highlight who doesn't respect the project enough to follow the style guide. Rules should be chosen with care, if too many rules accumulate it's not fair to ask people to follow them.

You may add to these guidelines by following the C4 protocol as usual. If there's a problem that frequently occurs and the simplest solution is to add a new style to these guidelines, then do it.

### COMMENTS
- Code should be broken to small pieces (couple of lines each), every piece doing one simple task.
- Each piece should be preceded by a comment explaining what is its intent.
- Each code piece should be followed by a blank line.
- The text of comment begins with a capital letter and ends by a period.
